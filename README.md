## Stakeholders

Our end-users are Young Adults in NYC. We conducted an interview with Georgia M., a student living in the city, and through our discussions identified a primary interest in discovering new restaurants in the city efficiently.

**Identified needs:**

* Wants to discover new hidden gem restaurants in a more intuitive way
* Wants personalized recommendations catered to her preferences
* A way to automate the decision process or narrow down choices quicker
* Wants to easily share new restaurants

**Identified frustrations:**

* Most apps consist of differing and unreliable reviews
* Most apps have outdated or bloated restaurant info
* It takes a long time to find a restaurant to try
* Viewing restaurants as a list feels overwhelming and cluttered

## Product Vision Statement

A decision-making application that by intaking user-chosen filters, user responses to a series of questions, and/or having users swipe on restaurants that match their requests, will provide them with the best choice for their next NYC food destination.

## User Requirements

**User Stories:**

* As a remote worker, I want to be able to find laptop-friendly cafes so that I can work in peace.
* As an office worker, I want to be able to find quick fast-casual places so I’m not frantically searching during my lunch breaks.

* As a vegan, I want to see if a restaurant has vegan-friendly options without the hassle of digging into their website menu so that I can show up to a place with the assurance that I can enjoy the food.
* As a student, I want to narrow down my options by price so that I can eat tasty food that fits my budget.

* As a busy professional, I want to filter restaurants based on availability (e.g. open now, reservations required) so that I can find a place that fits my schedule.
* As a foodie, I want to filter restaurants based on the type of cuisine they serve so I can try new foods.

* As an indecisive person, I want an option that suggests a restaurant for me when I just can’t seem to decide.
* As an exhausted worker, I want the ability to swipe left or right on individual restaurant choices so I can easily indicate my preferences without being overwhelmed by the need to evaluate all options at once.

* As someone who doesn’t eat out often, I want to make sure the places I do decide to go to have great reviews so I don’t waste my money on an unsavory meal.
* As a homebody, I want to be able to locate a solid takeout spot no more than a 5 minute walk  from me without endlessly clicking through Google Maps, so I can utilize that time watching my favorite show instead.
