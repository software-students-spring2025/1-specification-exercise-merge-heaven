## Stakeholders
Our end-users are Young Adults in NYC. We conducted an interview with Georgia M., a student living in the city, and through our discussions identified a primary interest in discovering new restaurants in the city efficiently.

**Identified needs:**
* wants to discover new hidden gem restaurants in a more intuitive way
* wants personalized recommendations catered to her preferences 
* a way to automate the decision process or narrow down choices quicker
* wants to easily save and track visited or favorite restaurants

**Identified frustrations:**
* most apps consist of unreliable reviews
* most apps have outdated or incorrect restaurant info
* it takes a long time to find a restaurant to try
* viewing restaurants as a list feels overwhelming and cluttered

## Product Vision Statement

A decision-making application that by intaking user-chosen filters, and user responses to a series of questions, will provide them with the best choice for their next NYC food destination.

## User Requirements

As a remote worker, I want to be able to find laptop-friendly cafes so that I can work in peace.

As an office worker, I want to be able to find quick fast-casual places so I’m not frantically searching during my lunch breaks.

As a vegan, I want to see if a restaurant has vegan-friendly options without the hassle of digging into their website menu so that I can show up to a place with the assurance that I can enjoy the food. 

As a student, I want to narrow down my options by price so that I can eat tasty food that fits my budget.

As a busy professional, I want to filter restaurants based on availability (e.g. open now, reservations required) so that I can find a place that fits my schedule.

As a foodie, I want to filter restaurants based on the type of cuisine they serve so I can try new foods. 

As an indecisive person, I want an option that suggests a restaurant for me when I just can’t seem to decide. 

As an exhausted worker, I want the ability to swipe left or right on individual restaurant choices so I can easily indicate my preferences without being overwhelmed by the need to evaluate all options at once. 

As someone who doesn’t eat out often, I want to make sure the places I do decide to go to have great reviews so I don’t waste my money on an unsavory meal. 

As a homebody, I want to be able to locate a solid takeout spot no more than a 5 minute walk  from me without endlessly clicking through Google Maps, so I can utilize that time watching my favorite show instead.
